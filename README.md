# CPAN228-FinalProject
 Spring Boot final project for group collaboration 

 ## Instructions to run it
 1. Do a git clone from the repository
 2. Open your code editor(Vscode, Intellij) I'm using vscode so the following steps may not apply
 3. This project uses Java 21, make sure your Java version is 21 or higher to determine this just do java --version. If you don't have it download it online and switch to it(Assuming that it doesn't switch you to 21 immediately)

 3.5. If you are like me and use VScode make sure the following extensions are installed
 - Java extension pack
 - Spring boot extension pack
 - Lombok support(Optional, are we going to use this?)

 4. This may be optional because I could run it without building it but in case you do. Change directory into the project folder and do mvn clean install. If you're in vscode you might want to do a Clean Java Language Server Workspace by doing ctrl+shift+p and typing that in. This is so you can import the build but VScode usually should automatically do that so it may not be nessecary. Nonetheless, I'm leaving it there in case
 5. Check the application properties folder. I put some configuration for xampp mysql but change anything if it doesn't match your configuration 
 6.You should be good to go, run the project and go to localhost:8080
